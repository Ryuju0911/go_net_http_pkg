// Do sends an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response, following
// policy (such as redirects, cookies, auth) as configured on the
// client.
//
// An error is returned if caused by client policy (such as
// CheckRedirect), or failure to speak HTTP (such as a network
// connectivity problem). A non-2xx status code doesn't cause an
// error.
//
// If the returned error is nil, the Response will contain a non-nil
// Body which the user is expected to close. If the Body is not both
// read to EOF and closed, the Client's underlying RoundTripper
// (typically Transport) may not be able to re-use a persistent TCP
// connection to the server for a subsequent "keep-alive" request.
//
// The request Body, if non-nil, will be closed by the underlying
// Transport, even on errors. The Body may be closed asynchronously after
// Do returns.
//
// On error, any Response can be ignored. A non-nil Response with a
// non-nil error only occurs when CheckRedirect fails, and even then
// the returned Response.Body is already closed.
//
// Generally Get, Post, or PostForm will be used instead of Do.
//
// If the server replies with a redirect, the Client first uses the
// CheckRedirect function to determine whether the redirect should be
// followed. If permitted, a 301, 302, or 303 redirect causes
// subsequent requests to use HTTP method GET
// (or HEAD if the original request was HEAD), with no body.
// A 307 or 308 redirect preserves the original HTTP method and body,
// provided that the Request.GetBody function is defined.
// The NewRequest function automatically sets GetBody for common
// standard library body types.
//
// Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error
// value's Timeout method will report true if the request timed out.
func (c *Client) Do(req *Request) (*Response, error) {
	// TODO: Implement c.do and call it here.
