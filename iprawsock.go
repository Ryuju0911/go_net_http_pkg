// BUG(mikio): On every POSIX platform, reads from the "ip4" network
// using the ReadFrom or ReadFromIP method might not return a complete
// IPv4 packet, including its header, even if there is space
// available. This can occur even in cases where Read or ReadMsgIP
// could return a complete packet. For this reason, it is recommended
// that you do not use these methods if it is important to receive a
// full packet.
//
// The Go 1 compatibility guidelines make it impossible for us to
// change the behavior of these methods; use Read or ReadMsgIP
// instead.

// BUG(mikio): On JS and Plan 9, methods and functions related
// to IPConn are not implemented.

// BUG(mikio): On Windows, the File method of IPConn is not
// implemented.
